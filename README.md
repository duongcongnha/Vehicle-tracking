# Vehicle tracking with Yolov5 + Deep Sort with PyTorch

## Note
For everyones comes here from youtube or just want to use my repo for inference. This is an very old project just for learning Computer Vision when i was in school. It's been a long time so I forgot almost everything that I did in this toy project. I've editted from this <a href="https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/yolov8_tracking">repo</a> and add some lines of code for some constraints. You guys can use that <a href="https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/yolov8_tracking">repo</a> for references. Thanks.

The detections are generated by [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) are passed to  [Deep Sort algorithm](https://github.com/ZQPei/deep_sort_pytorch) which tracks the objects.

## Before running the tracker

Python 3.7.12 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

    
## Config

`settings/`
<br></br>
`config.yml`  `deepsort.yml`  `db_config.yml`

## Running tracker

```
cd application/main
python app_track.py
```

## Saving result
Results can be save to databse: `upload_db` in file `config.yml`
